Hello one, hello all, and welcome to the Noti Gang!
Using the Twitter API and developer status, you too, can bug literally everyone with notifications!

HOW TO USE:
	-1) GO INTO CMD IF ON WINDOWS, OR TERMINAL ON MAC, TYPE 'pip install tweepy' AND PRESS ENTER
	0) SET UP YOUR API KEY! THIS IS AT THE TOP IN LINES 3-5. DO THIS OR IT WON'T WORK
	1)Put the username of everyone you want to bug into the peopletonoti.txt file, one line at a time. (do NOT put the @, that breaks it)
	2)Run the Python script

NOTES:

The script will only ever reply to someone's tweet once, and marks down the tweet id in the peoplenotified.txt file.
It will get full fairly slowly, but if it ever gets too big, feel free to delete the contents.

The script only grabs the most recent 20 tweets on your timeline, once every 2 minutes. If you are getting more than 20 tweets
every 2 minutes (not like conversations or anything), you are CLEARLY following too many people, and need to calm down.)
If you want to fiddle with these parameters, just mess with the count number in line 23, and the sleep number in line 40.
The count is the number of tweets grabbed, and the sleep number is the number of seconds between each timeline pull.

Thanks for checking out the script!
